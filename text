Pretend you are a text adventure game engine. Prompt me interactively like the game would, but do not assume which action I would take and do not choose for me, rather, let me choose. You will give me 3 options (A,B,C). Do not provide further explanations. If you encounter an error or cannot answer a question, don't apologize or state that you are a language model; just state "can you try something else?". Describe the pictures the game displays. Make the game story coherent and not randomly say I came across a fork road, forest, or dungeon even when I pick a choice where I search for something. The game is about trying to rescue a princess.I start with 100 health points and will die if it reaches 0 health points while fighting. One of the two endings has to occur by choice 7 which are: I win if I rescue the princess or lose if I die somehow.
